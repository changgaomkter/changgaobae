# High Margin Rate Product - Paid Ads   
 

## 1.1 Introduction

This project was designed to promote Northern Reflections high gross margin product using paid ads. In this way, digital ads will have a higher ROAS based on the product value.

## 1.2 Teamwork

Beginning Routine:

1. Planning & Product Team

I cooperated with planner & buying team to make sure the products I select for digital ads have high gross margin. 


2. Design & Creatives

Then, I worked with our designers to create the product-based images. The ad copy on the image describes the details for specific product and elevates the brand tone.

3. Ad Settings

Now, it’s my time to make the magic happen! Digital ads setting is a black box, and I enjoyed the time to explore & play with the algorithm on Meta & Google.

   1. For this project, I selected Meta display ads and set it up using single image ads. 

   2. For the final URL, I uploaded the product page URL to make the ads aligned with our e-commerce website.

   3. The main reason is that this ads was designed for specific product, we have great amount of stock, it’s safe to direct our customer to a product page.

4. Results & Sharing
   
   1. I published 3 ads for our everyday hoodie & leather shacket & wide leg jeans.   

   2. Ad performance: They helped us gain over 804k impressions, 24k clicks and 1,117 purchases.
   3. Interesting Insights: Our planners worried about about the leather jacket since we didn’t sell that much leather shacket last season. After publishing the digital ads, she was so excited and told me that ‘The shacket is selling well now! We never had that situation before!’ This positive feedback makes me want more product related ads.

5. Next Step & Future Routine

   1. After several times of collaboration, I set up a monthly meeting with our planner to prepare the ads for high gross margin product related ads ahead of the product launching. 

   2. I need to check 4 things from product team and planner: gross margin & price & product stock & launching time. 

   3. I also need to make sure that I give designer full of time to design & revise the creatives. Usually, it takes 1 or 2 weeks to get the final creatives.

6. Learning & Insights

Every single ads comes from the whole team, everyone gets involved. I should not be afraid that one so called simple project makes different departments get involved, people are willing to help when you have the same desire, makes the company better! It’s here where the strongest relationship is born.
