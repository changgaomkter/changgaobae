# Media Pausing Test

## 1.Background

We want to test out how much paid ads contribute to e-commerce and in-store sales. The end of Q4 is great time for us start the test:

> 1.1 The budget is limited, we didnâ€™t have enough budget to ramp up the campaigns.

> 1.2The spring collection was not loaded. For all the retail brands, there were several weeks in Q4 or Q1, there was a stock issue when most of styles were old Winter or Holiday styles. We could not publish new ads, we would rather save the money for the coming styles.

> 1.3We want to use this test to convince or prove that digital ads contribute a lot for the sales. We spent the money, and we earned more!

## 2.Learning & Insights

> Pausing all the digital ads sounds like a bold decision, but we could learn from the test and explore more for the coming busy seasons.
