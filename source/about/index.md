## Working EXPERIENCE

### May 2022 - May 2023

<div align='right'>`Software Development Engineer-Testing in Huawei` <img src="//www-file.huawei.com/-/media/corporate/images/home/logo/huawei_logo.png" width="150" align='right'> </div>  

**1.** Prepared automatic engineering test plans in Java and carried out more than 300 engineering testing assignments. Reported test results and provide recommendations for the project team.

**2.** Developed automated test cases for 20+ requirements to validate software features.

**3.** Participated in 20+ full-scale product integration tests & had experience coding large projects.

**4.** Guaranteed 20+ new products launched successfully with solid programming skills (Java).

**5.** Collaborated with software engineers from multiple teams to locate bugs. Developed test architectures & methods for verifying the performance of the software.

**6.** Produced technical drawings, weekly reports, and other documentation for the product owners, developers, and QA management to identify requirements and anticipated risks.

### August 2020 – June 2021  

<div align='right'>`Software Development Engineer-Testing in Tencent` <img src="https://www.tencent.com/img/index/menu_logo_hover.png" width="150" align='right'> </div>  

**1.** Used python to write UI automatic test scripts on Enterprise WeChat ios, and maintained and monitored the execution of automated test cases

**2.** Wrote more than 1,000 UI automation test cases under the WDA framework to improve the test efficiency of the Enterprise WeChat ios version and help enterprises save about 15% of the test time, which reduce manpower input by about 4 people
   
**3.**	Wrote multiple low-level test functions to improve the use case efficiency of colleagues and helped reproduce and modify bugs

**4.**	Wrote a front-end code to participate in the company's anniversary event, which was selected and displayed in the company's tweet during the company's anniversary

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
### September 2019 – January 2020
<div align='right'> `Research on Key Technologies of Dynamic Detection of Land and Features Based on Remote Sensing Images` </div>  
**1.** Participated in the design of a complete set of ground object condition monitoring programs, and achieved good monitoring results
  
**2.** Attempted to reproduce and compare traditional remote sensing methods (such as principal component transformation method, difference threshold method, wavelet transform method) and artificial intelligence algorithm (convolution operation) to extract the state changes of ground objects

### May 2019 – April 2020  
<div align='right'> `Thesis Paper: "The Influence of Housing Price Micro-factors Based on BP Neural Network Algorithm"`</div>

**1.** Used Python language to write crawler programs to crawl more than 3,000 listings on Lianjia and Anjuke, converted addresses into coordinate data, and wrote algorithms to convert coordinate data into distances
  
**2.** Used matlab to write BP neural network algorithm to train house price data, and finally controlled the error of house price prediction value within 15% according to 15 microscopic factors of the house (the area of the house, the floor, the orientation, the green rate of the community, the number of various surrounding public facilities, etc.) 
  
**3.** Participated in the theoretical analysis and empirical analysis of BP neural network in the whole process, and can output the model during empirical analysis and gave a comprehensive and reasonable explanation to the results of the model output during the empirical analysis

### April 2020 – July 2020  
<div align='right'>`Database Course Experiment`</div>
**1.** Created a WebGis system to display the geographical location of the monsters in Shanhaijing on a modern map, built a system database, and realized the function of inserting, deleting, updating and selecting information about monsters
  
**2.** Used C# language to write back-end code to realize data connection between front-end and back-end and database through AJAX
  
**3.** Wrote 3-page front-end code 

###  June 2020 – July 2020  
<div align='right'>`Integrated Internship in Spatial Data Processing`</div>

**1.** Used Python language to write programs to achieve HSV, Brovey, HIS, PCA fusion of remote sensing images
  
**2.** Wrote a Python program to simulate the mixing of celestial noise, geomagnetic signals, etc. and used Kalman filter to denoise the signal

**3.** Wrote a Python program to process electromagnetic signals collected by satellites and extracted the time zone and location of the satellite's magnetic reconnection across the magnetopause

### March 2021 – May 2021  
<div align='right'>`Improvements in Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Algorithms`</div>

**1.** Wrote an algorithm to automatically rasterize files in shp format into images in png format as training data for neural networks
  
**2.** Improved the structure of the unet network based on the pytorch framework using the Python language, and designed the ResUnet network so as to realize the intelligent extraction algorithm for the Chengdu water body with the extraction accuracy reaching 98.85%
  
**3.** Completed the writing of the paper "Algorithm Implementation of Intelligent Extraction of Urban Water in Chengdu Based on High-Definition Remote Sensing", and designed the resunet network structure with the extraction effect of water bodies better than unet, dlinknet, and deeplabv3+
